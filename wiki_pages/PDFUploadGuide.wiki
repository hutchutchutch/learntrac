= PDF Upload Guide =

This page allows you to upload educational PDFs to the LearnTrac system. Uploaded PDFs will be automatically processed through our advanced pipeline that:

 * Extracts and analyzes content structure
 * Creates intelligent semantic chunks
 * Generates high-quality embeddings
 * Stores everything in Neo4j for intelligent retrieval

== Upload Form ==

Use the form below to upload your PDF:

[[PDFUpload]]

== What Happens After Upload ==

When you upload a PDF, the system will:

 1. **Extract Content**: Parse the PDF to extract text, structure, figures, tables, and code blocks
 2. **Chunk Intelligently**: Break content into semantically meaningful chunks of 250-300 words
 3. **Generate Embeddings**: Create vector embeddings using OpenAI's models
 4. **Store in Neo4j**: Build a knowledge graph with concepts, prerequisites, and relationships
 5. **Enable Search**: Make content searchable through semantic similarity

== Supported Content Types ==

The system is optimized for educational content including:
 * Textbooks
 * Course materials
 * Technical documentation
 * Research papers
 * Tutorial guides

== Processing Details ==

=== Chunking Strategy ===
 * Average chunk size: 250-300 words
 * Preserves context and educational structure
 * Identifies content types (definitions, examples, exercises)
 * Extracts key concepts and prerequisites

=== Embedding Generation ===
 * Primary model: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 (1536 dimensions)
 * Quality assessment ensures high-quality embeddings
 * Educational alignment scoring

=== Neo4j Storage ===
 * Hierarchical structure: Textbook → Chapters → Sections → Chunks
 * Concept extraction and linking
 * Prerequisite tracking
 * Vector similarity indexing

== Search Your Content ==

After uploading, you can search your content using:
 * [/wiki/LearningSearch Natural language queries]
 * [/wiki/ConceptExplorer Concept exploration]
 * [/wiki/LearningPaths Personalized learning paths]

== API Access ==

For programmatic uploads, use the REST API:

{{{
POST /api/trac/textbooks/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>

file: <pdf-file>
title: "Your Textbook Title"
subject: "Computer Science"
authors: ["Author 1", "Author 2"]
}}}

== Troubleshooting ==

=== Large Files ===
Files over 50MB may take several minutes to process. The system will:
 * Show upload progress
 * Continue processing in the background
 * Send notification when complete

=== Processing Errors ===
If processing fails:
 * Check that the PDF contains readable text (not scanned images)
 * Ensure the file is not corrupted
 * Verify you have upload permissions

== Advanced Upload ==

For authenticated uploads with additional security:

[[PDFUpload(subject=Computer Science,require_auth=true)]]
