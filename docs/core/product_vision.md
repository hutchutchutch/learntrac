# Product Vision Guide - AI-Powered Learning Path Generation for Trac 1.4.4

## Executive Summary

This product vision guide outlines the transformation of Trac 1.4.4 from a project management system into a dual-purpose platform that also serves as an automated learning path generator. By leveraging Trac's existing project tracking infrastructure, we enable curious learners to generate structured educational roadmaps where learning topics become "projects," concepts become "tickets," and knowledge acquisition follows the same progress tracking methodologies used in software development.
