# AWS Cognito Authentication Migration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of AWS Cognito token-based authentication for LearnTrac, migrating from HTTP Basic Authentication to a secure JWT-based system.

## Completed Components

### 1. Backend Token Validation (`/plugins/cognito_token_validator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Secure JWT token validation with cryptographic verification
- **Features**:
  - JWKS-based token signature verification using PyJWT
  - Token expiration and issuer validation
  - Caching of JWKS keys for performance
  - Extraction of user information from token claims

### 2. Enhanced Authentication Plugin (`/plugins/trac_cognito_auth.py`)
- **Purpose**: Main authentication handler supporting both session and Bearer token auth
- **Features**:
  - Bearer token authentication for API endpoints
  - OAuth2 login flow via Cognito Hosted UI
  - Token refresh endpoint (`/auth/refresh`)
  - Integration with metrics tracking
  - Proper 401 responses with WWW-Authenticate headers for APIs

### 3. Permission Policy (`/plugins/cognito_permission_policy.py`)
- **Purpose**: Maps Cognito groups to Trac permissions
- **Group Mappings**:
  - `admins`: Full administrative access (TRAC_ADMIN, etc.)
  - `instructors`: Create/modify tickets, wikis, milestones, reports
  - `students`: View-only access with ability to create tickets
- **Features**:
  - Support for custom permissions from Lambda
  - Dynamic permission checking based on Cognito groups

### 4. Metrics Component (`/plugins/cognito_metrics.py`)
- **Purpose**: Track authentication events for monitoring
- **Features**:
  - Automatic creation of auth_metrics table
  - Recording of authentication events (success/failure)
  - Statistics API for monitoring dashboards
  - Recent failure tracking for security monitoring

### 5. Test Suite (`/test_cognito_auth.py`)
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive authentication testing
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Cognito login flow
  - Bearer token API access
  - Token refresh mechanism
  - Invalid token handling
  - Permission mapping validation

### 6. Configuration Updates (`/conf/trac.ini`)
- **Changes**:
  - Enabled all Cognito components
  - Added CognitoPermissionPolicy to permission chain
  - Configured token settings and API paths
  - Disabled traditional login module

## Authentication Flow

### Web-Based Authentication
1. User visits `/auth/login`
2. Redirected to Cognito Hosted UI
3. After successful login, redirected back to `/auth/callback`
4. Code exchanged for tokens
5. ID token validated cryptographically
6. Session established with user info and groups

### API Authentication
1. Client obtains tokens from Cognito
2. Sends request with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
3. Token validated using JWKS
4. User permissions checked based on groups
5. Request processed or 401 returned

### Token Refresh
1. Client POSTs refresh token to `/auth/refresh`
2. New access and ID tokens returned
3. Client updates stored tokens

## Security Features
- Cryptographic JWT validation using RS256
- Token expiration enforcement
- Secure session storage
- Metrics tracking for anomaly detection
- Group-based permission enforcement

## Python-Only Implementation
As requested, this implementation is entirely Python-based with no JavaScript components. All token management happens server-side or through API clients.

## Next Steps for Production
1. Test with real Cognito user accounts
2. Configure monitoring alerts based on metrics
3. Set up log aggregation for auth events
4. Performance test token validation under load
5. Document API authentication for developers

## Success Metrics
- All API endpoints require valid Bearer tokens
- Token validation completes in < 100ms
- Cognito groups properly map to permissions
- Metrics capture all authentication events
- Zero regression in existing functionality
