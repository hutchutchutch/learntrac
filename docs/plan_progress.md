# LearnTrac Infrastructure Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of implementing the LearnTrac infrastructure plan from `/docs/plan.md`. The plan involves creating a dual-Python architecture where Trac runs on Python 2.7 and new LearnTrac features run on Python 3.11+, all managed through Terraform on AWS.

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1.1 Terraform Module Structure ✅
- [x] Create modular directory structure
- [x] Set up environment-specific configurations
- [x] Implement module interfaces

#### 1.2 Networking & Load Balancing ✅
- [x] Configure ALB with path-based routing
- [x] Set up target groups for Trac and LearnTrac
- [x] Configure SSL/HTTPS listeners

#### 1.3 Container Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Create ECS cluster configuration
- [x] Set up ECR repositories
- [x] Configure Fargate services

### Phase 2: Application Containers ✅ COMPLETED

#### 2.1 Trac Legacy Container (Python 2.7) ✅
- [x] Create Dockerfile for Trac
- [x] Configure requirements.txt
- [x] Create startup scripts

#### 2.2 LearnTrac API Container (Python 3.11) ✅
- [x] Create Dockerfile for LearnTrac
- [x] Set up FastAPI application structure
- [x] Implement database bridge

### Phase 3: Supporting Services ⚡ IN PROGRESS

#### 3.1 Data Layer
- [x] RDS PostgreSQL (already configured)
- [x] Redis/ElastiCache for sessions
- [ ] Neo4j configuration (optional for initial deployment)

#### 3.2 Serverless Components
- [ ] Lambda functions for voice/chat
- [ ] API Gateway for WebSocket
- [ ] Lambda integrations

### Phase 4: Deployment & Operations ⚡ IN PROGRESS

#### 4.1 CI/CD Pipeline
- [x] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions
- [x] Configure auto-scaling

#### 4.2 Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] CloudWatch dashboards
- [ ] Alarms and notifications
- [ ] Log aggregation

## Current Status
- **Started**: 2025-07-23
- **Current Phase**: Ready for initial deployment
- **Next Steps**: Run deployment script to test infrastructure

## Key Decisions Made
1. Using Fargate for ECS to avoid EC2 management
2. Path-based routing via ALB to separate Trac/LearnTrac traffic
3. Shared RDS database with compatibility layer
4. Redis for session management across both systems
5. Modular Terraform structure for easy maintenance

## Infrastructure Components Created

### Terraform Modules
- **ALB Module**: Application Load Balancer with path-based routing
- **ECS Module**: Reusable ECS service configuration with auto-scaling
- **Redis**: ElastiCache configuration for session management
- **ECR**: Container registries for both Trac and LearnTrac

### Docker Containers
- **Trac Legacy**: Python 2.7 container with Trac 1.4.4
- **LearnTrac API**: Python 3.11 container with FastAPI

### Scripts
- **deploy.sh**: Automated deployment script for building and deploying
- **setup-local.sh**: Local development environment setup

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
2. Docker installed and running
3. Terraform installed

### Deployment Steps
1. Navigate to the project root
2. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh dev apply
   ```

### Local Development
1. Run the local setup script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-local.sh
   ```

## Next Actions
1. Test the deployment script
2. Verify ECS services start correctly
3. Test ALB routing between Trac and LearnTrac
4. Add monitoring and CloudWatch dashboards
5. Implement Lambda functions for advanced features

## Notes
- Infrastructure is ready for initial deployment
- Lambda functions and API Gateway WebSocket can be added incrementally
- Neo4j is optional and can be added later as needed
