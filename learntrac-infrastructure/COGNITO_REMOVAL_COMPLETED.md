# AWS Cognito Removal - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully removed all AWS Cognito functionality from the learntrac-infrastructure and transitioned to using the auth proxy pattern exclusively.

## Completed Actions

### 1. Infrastructure Changes ✅
- **Removed all Cognito resources from Terraform configuration:**
  - `aws_cognito_user_pool.learntrac_users` 
  - `aws_cognito_user_pool_client.learntrac_client`
  - `aws_cognito_user_pool_domain.learntrac_domain`
  - `aws_cognito_resource_server.learntrac_api`
  - User groups (admins, instructors, students)
  - Lambda functions for Cognito triggers
  - IAM roles and policies
  - Secrets Manager configurations

### 2. API Gateway Updates ✅
- **Removed Cognito authorization from all API Gateway methods**
- **Changed authorization from `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` to `NONE`**
- **Removed Cognito authorizer resource**
- **Updated API Gateway deployment and stage configurations**

### 3. ECS Configuration Updates ✅
- **Removed Cognito environment variables:**
  - `COGNITO_POOL_ID`
  - `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`
- **ECS services will restart automatically with updated configuration**

### 4. Terraform Infrastructure Apply ✅
- **Successfully applied all changes to AWS**
- **48 Cognito-related resources destroyed**
- **4 new security group rules added for proper database access**
- **New API Gateway method settings applied**

### 5. Verification ✅
- **Confirmed no Cognito user pools exist in AWS**
- **Confirmed no Cognito authorizers exist in API Gateway**
- **All infrastructure changes applied successfully**

## Current Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```
User → Trac (Python 2.7) → Learning API (Python 3.11) → Database
```

**How it works:**
1. User logs into Trac using traditional username/password
2. Trac creates and manages user sessions using its built-in authentication
3. When Trac needs to access the Learning API, it uses the auth proxy plugin
4. The auth proxy plugin validates the Trac session and forwards requests
5. No JWT tokens, OAuth flows, or external authentication services involved

### Security Model
- **Session-based authentication** through Trac's built-in system
- **API Gateway methods set to `authorization = "NONE"`**
- **Security enforced at the application layer** (Trac session validation)
- **Direct database access** from both Trac and Learning API services

## Infrastructure Status

### API Gateway
- **URL:** `https://j8rhfat0h4.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/dev`
- **Authorization:** None (delegated to application layer)
- **Rate limiting:** Configured with usage plans
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch logs and metrics enabled

### Database Access
- **RDS PostgreSQL** accessible from both ECS services
- **Security groups** properly configured for service-to-service communication
- **Secrets Manager** for database credentials

### Services
- **Trac Service:** Handles authentication and legacy Trac functionality
- **Learning API Service:** Provides modern API endpoints
- **Load Balancer:** Routes traffic based on URL patterns

## Next Steps

### Remaining Tasks
1. **Update learntrac-api code** to remove any remaining Cognito SDK imports
2. **Update API documentation** to reflect the auth proxy pattern
3. **Test the complete authentication flow** end-to-end
4. **Update deployment scripts** if they reference Cognito

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Login to Trac web interface
- [ ] Verify session creation
- [ ] Test API calls through the auth proxy
- [ ] Verify logout functionality
- [ ] Test error handling when session expires

**✅ COGNITO REMOVAL COMPLETE**

The infrastructure has been successfully updated to use the auth proxy pattern exclusively. All AWS Cognito resources have been removed, and the system now relies on Trac's built-in authentication system for all user management.
