# ECR to ECS Connectivity Best Practices

## Current Issue
The ECS tasks are failing to pull images from ECR with the error:
```
ResourceInitializationError: unable to pull secrets or registry auth: 
The task cannot pull registry auth from Amazon ECR
```

This is because:
1. ECS tasks are configured with `assign_public_ip = false` in the Terraform module
2. Tasks are running in private subnets without NAT Gateway or VPC endpoints
3. ECR requires internet connectivity or VPC endpoints to pull images

## Solution Options

### Option 1: VPC Endpoints (Recommended for Production)
**Best for**: Production environments, security-conscious deployments

**Pros**:
- No internet exposure
- Lower data transfer costs
- Better security
- Consistent performance

**Cons**:
- Additional hourly costs for interface endpoints (~$0.01/hour per endpoint per AZ)
- More complex setup

**Implementation**:
1. Apply the `vpc-endpoints.tf` file created
2. Keep `assign_public_ip = false` in ECS module
3. Ensures all traffic stays within AWS network

### Option 2: Public IP Assignment (Quick Fix)
**Best for**: Development environments, quick testing

**Pros**:
- Simple to implement
- No additional costs
- Already implemented via AWS CLI

**Cons**:
- Tasks have public IPs (security concern)
- Higher data transfer costs
- Requires public subnets

**Implementation**:
```hcl
# In modules/ecs/main.tf, change line 168:
assign_public_ip = true  # or make it configurable via variable
```

### Option 3: NAT Gateway
**Best for**: When you need general internet access from private subnets

**Pros**:
- Tasks remain in private subnets
- Provides general internet access
- Standard pattern for private subnet internet access

**Cons**:
- Most expensive option (~$45/month per NAT Gateway)
- Data processing charges
- Single point of failure unless using multiple AZs

## Recommended Approach

For your current setup, I recommend:

1. **Short term**: Continue with public IP assignment (already done via AWS CLI)
2. **Long term**: Implement VPC endpoints by applying the Terraform configuration

## To Apply VPC Endpoints

1. Review the `vpc-endpoints.tf` file
2. Run Terraform plan to see changes:
   ```bash
   cd learntrac-infrastructure
   terraform plan
   ```
3. Apply the changes:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
4. Update ECS services to remove public IP assignment:
   ```bash
   aws ecs update-service \
     --cluster hutch-learntrac-dev-cluster \
     --service hutch-learntrac-dev-trac \
     --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[subnet-068fcd2e51c94a130,subnet-03260fcd9c243f7b8,subnet-03595b890b049b697],securityGroups=[sg-099f0e67fcf8b6870],assignPublicIp=DISABLED}" \
     --region us-east-2
   ```

## Cost Comparison

| Solution | Monthly Cost (estimate) | Notes |
|----------|------------------------|--------|
| VPC Endpoints | ~$108 | 5 endpoints × 3 AZs × $0.01/hour |
| Public IPs | ~$15-30 | Data transfer costs vary |
| NAT Gateway | ~$135 | $45/month + data processing |

## Security Considerations

1. **VPC Endpoints**: Most secure, all traffic stays within AWS
2. **Public IPs**: Tasks exposed to internet, use security groups carefully
3. **NAT Gateway**: Secure for tasks, but adds complexity

## Monitoring

After implementation, monitor:
- ECS task startup times
- ECR pull success rates
- VPC endpoint metrics (if using)
- Data transfer costs
