## Deployment Date: 2025-07-23

### üöÄ Deployment Progress

1. **Docker Images Built**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Trac image with Cognito plugin
   - LearnTrac API with JWT authentication

2. **Local Testing**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Both containers running successfully
   - Connected to AWS RDS PostgreSQL
   - Connected to AWS ElastiCache Redis
   - Authentication middleware configured

3. **ECR Push**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Trac image: `971422717446.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hutch-learntrac-dev-trac:latest`
   - LearnTrac API: `971422717446.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hutch-learntrac-dev-learntrac:latest`

4. **ECS Deployment**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
   - Services updated at 17:51-17:52 UTC
   - Both services currently deploying new task definitions
   - Expected completion: ~10-15 minutes

### üìç Production Endpoints

Once deployment completes, the services will be available at:

- **Application Load Balancer**: `hutch-learntrac-dev-alb-1826735098.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com`
- **Trac Legacy**: `http://hutch-learntrac-dev-alb-1826735098.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com` (Port 80)
- **LearnTrac API**: `http://hutch-learntrac-dev-alb-1826735098.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/api/learntrac/*`

### üîç Monitoring Commands

Check deployment status:
```bash
aws ecs describe-services \
  --cluster hutch-learntrac-dev-cluster \
  --services hutch-learntrac-dev-trac hutch-learntrac-dev-learntrac \
  --region us-east-2
```

View ECS task logs:
```bash
# Get task ARN
aws ecs list-tasks --cluster hutch-learntrac-dev-cluster --region us-east-2

# View logs
aws logs tail /ecs/hutch-learntrac-dev-trac --region us-east-2
aws logs tail /ecs/hutch-learntrac-dev-learntrac --region us-east-2
```

### üéØ Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Verify ALB Health Checks**:
   ```bash
   curl http://hutch-learntrac-dev-alb-1826735098.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/health
   ```

2. **Test Cognito Authentication**:
   - Navigate to ALB URL + `/login`
   - Verify redirect to Cognito hosted UI

3. **Configure Route 53** (if needed):
   - Point custom domain to ALB
   - Update Cognito redirect URIs

4. **Set Up CloudWatch Alarms**:
   - ECS task failures
   - ALB unhealthy targets
   - High error rates

### üìä Infrastructure Details

- **ECS Cluster**: `hutch-learntrac-dev-cluster`
- **VPC**: Default VPC with VPC endpoints configured
- **Subnets**: Multi-AZ deployment across 3 subnets
- **Security Groups**: Configured for ALB, ECS, RDS, and Redis access
- **Cognito User Pool**: `us-east-2_IvxzMrWwg`
- **Cognito Domain**: `hutch-learntrac-dev-auth`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. The Trac Cognito plugin requires a proper WSGI server for full OAuth functionality. The current deployment uses tracd which has limitations.
2. Ensure Cognito redirect URIs are updated to include the ALB domain.
3. VPC endpoints are configured for private ECR access, reducing data transfer costs.
