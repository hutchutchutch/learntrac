# LearnTrac Deployment Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### ✅ Completed Tasks:
1. **Docker Images Built**:
   - `hutch-learntrac-dev-trac:latest` (434MB) - Python 2.7 Trac placeholder
   - `hutch-learntrac-dev-learntrac:latest` (176MB) - Python 3.11 FastAPI service

2. **Files Created/Modified**:
   - Fixed Trac Dockerfile to use archived Debian repositories
   - Created simplified LearnTrac API for initial deployment
   - Created deployment scripts and instructions

### 📋 Remaining Steps (Execute on AWS-enabled system):

#### Option 1: Quick Deployment
```bash
cd /workspaces/learntrac
./scripts/quick-deploy.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment
Follow the steps in `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### 🔗 Important URLs:
- **ALB Endpoint**: http://hutch-learntrac-dev-alb-1826735098.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/
- **Trac ECR**: 971422717446.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hutch-learntrac-dev-trac
- **LearnTrac ECR**: 971422717446.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/hutch-learntrac-dev-learntrac

### 🚀 After Deployment:
1. Services will take 2-3 minutes to stabilize
2. Check CloudWatch logs for any startup issues
3. Test health endpoints to verify deployment
4. Configure environment variables as needed

### 📊 Expected Results:
- Trac service: Simple HTTP server on port 8000 (placeholder)
- LearnTrac API: FastAPI service on port 8001 with health endpoints
- Both accessible via ALB with path-based routing

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting:
- If tasks won't start: Check CloudWatch logs
- If 503 errors: Wait for health checks to pass (2-3 min)
- If connection issues: Verify security groups

### 📝 Next Phase:
Once basic services are running:
1. Configure database connections
2. Set up Redis integration
3. Implement actual Trac functionality
4. Add authentication/authorization
5. Deploy full LearnTrac features
